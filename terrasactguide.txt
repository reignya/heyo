Step-by-Step Fix
Install Tesseract:

If you haven't installed Tesseract yet, download it from the official Tesseract OCR GitHub page or the appropriate installer for your operating system:
For Windows: Tesseract at UB Mannheim.
Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.
Add Tesseract to Environment Variables (Windows):

Find the directory where Tesseract is installed (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).
Right-click on This PC or My Computer and select Properties.
Click on Advanced system settings.
In the System Properties window, click on the Environment Variables button.
In the System variables section, find the Path variable and select it, then click Edit.
In the Edit Environment Variable window, click New and add the path to your Tesseract installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR).
Click OK to close all windows.
Verify Installation:

Open a new Command Prompt window (make sure to open a new one after changing environment variables).
Type tesseract -v and press Enter. You should see the version of Tesseract displayed if the installation was successful.
